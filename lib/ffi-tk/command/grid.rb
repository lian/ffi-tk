    # If the first argument to grid is suitable as the first slave argument to
    # grid configure, either a window name (any value starting with .) or one of

    # spanning the rows and columns indicated is returned.

    # windows. For a window name, that window must be a slave of this master and
    # the options apply to all columns currently occupied be the slave.
    # The -minsize option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that will be
    # permitted for this column.
    # The -weight option (an integer value) sets the relative weight for

    # A weight of zero (0) indicates the column will not deviate from its
    # requested size.

    # in a uniform group with other columns that have the same value for
    # -uniform. The space for columns belonging to a uniform group is allocated
    # so that their sizes are always in strict proportion to their -weight
    # values. See THE GRID ALGORITHM below for further details.
    # The -pad option specifies the number of screen units that will be added to
    # the largest window contained completely in that column when the grid
    # geometry manager requests a size from the containing window.
