    # Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu.
    # The new entry's type is given by type and must be one of cascade,
    # checkbutton, command, radiobutton, or separator, or a unique abbreviation
    # of one of the above.
    # If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following
    # options: -activebackground value Specifies a background color to use for
    # displaying this entry when it is active.
    # If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    # activeBackground option for the overall menu is used.
    # If the tk_strictMotif variable has been set to request strict Motif
    # compliance, then this option is ignored and the -background option is
    # used in its place.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -activeforeground value Specifies a foreground color to use for
    # displaying this entry when it is active.
    # If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    # activeForeground option for the overall menu is used.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -accelerator value Specifies a string to display at the right side of the
    # menu entry.
    # Normally describes an accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed to
    # invoke the same function as the menu entry.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -background value Specifies a background color to use for displaying this
    # entry when it is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled).
    # If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    # background option for the overall menu is used.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -bitmap value Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a
    # textual label, in any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetBitmap.
    # This option overrides the -label option (as controlled by the -com‐ pound
    # option) but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual label to
    # be displayed.
    # If a -image option has been specified, it overrides -bitmap.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -columnbreak value When this option is zero, the entry appears below the
    # previous entry.
    # When this option is one, the entry appears at the top of a new column in
    # the menu.
    # -command value Specifies a Tcl command to execute when the menu entry is
    # invoked. Not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -compound value Specifies whether the menu entry should display both an
    # image and text, and if so, where the image should be placed relative to
    # the text.
    # Valid values for this option are bottom, cen‐ ter, left, none, right and
    # top. The default value is none, meaning that the button will display
    # either an image or text, depending on the values of the -image and
    # -bitmap options.
    # -font value Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or
    # accelerator string in this entry.
    # If this option is specified as an empty string (the default) then the
    # font option for the overall menu is used.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -foreground value Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this
    # entry when it is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled).
    # If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    # foreground option for the overall menu is used.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -hidemargin value Specifies whether the standard margins should be drawn
    # for this menu entry.
    # This is useful when creating palette with images in them, i.e., color
    # palettes, pattern palettes, etc.
    # 1 indicates that the margin for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the
    # margin is used.
    # -image value Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text
    # string or bitmap.
    # The image must have been created by some previous invocation of image
    # create. This option overrides the -label and -bitmap options (as
    # controlled by the -compound option) but may be reset to an empty string
    # to enable a textual or bitmap label to be displayed.
    # This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -indicatoron value Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton
    # entries. Value is a boolean that determines whether or not the indicator
    # should be displayed.
    # -label value Specifies a string to display as an identifying label in the
    # menu entry.
    # Not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -menu value Available only for cascade entries.
    # Specifies the path name of the submenu associated with this entry.
    # The submenu must be a child of the menu.
    # -offvalue value Available only for checkbutton entries.
    # Specifies the value to store in the entry's associated variable when the
    # entry is deselected.
    # -onvalue value Available only for checkbutton entries.
    # Specifies the value to store in the entry's associated variable when the
    # entry is selected.
    # -selectcolor value Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton
    # entries. Specifies the color to display in the indicator when the entry
    # is selected.
    # If the value is an empty string (the default) then the selectColor option
    # for the menu determines the indicator color.
    # -selectimage value Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton
    # entries. Specifies an image to display in the entry (in place of the
    # -image option) when it is selected.
    # Value is the name of an image, which must have been created by some
    # previous invocation of image create.
    # This option is ignored unless the -image option has been specified.
    # -state value Specifies one of three states for the entry: normal, active,
    # or disabled.
    # In normal state the entry is displayed using the foreground option for
    # the menu and the background option from the entry or the menu.
    # The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the entry.
    # In active state the entry is displayed using the activeForeground option
    # for the menu along with the activebackground option from the entry.
    # Disabled state means that the entry should be insensitive: the default
    # bindings will refuse to activate or invoke the entry.
    # In this state the entry is displayed according to the disabledForeground
    # option for the menu and the background option from the entry.
    # This option is not available for separa‐ tor entries.
    # -underline value Specifies the integer index of a character to underline
    # in the entry.
    # This option is also queried by the default bindings and used to implement
    # keyboard traversal.
    # 0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed in the entry,
    # 1 to the next character, and so on.
    # If a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry then this option is
    # ignored. This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.
    # -value value Available only for radiobutton entries.
    # Specifies the value to store in the entry's associated variable when the
    # entry is selected.
    # If an empty string is specified, then the -label option for the entry as
    # the value to store in the variable.
    # -variable value Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.
    # Specifies the name of a global value to set when the entry is selected.
    # For checkbutton entries the variable is also set when the entry is
    # deselected. For radiobutton entries, changing the variable causes the
    # currently-selected entry to deselect itself.
    # The add widget command returns an empty string.

    # Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu window

    # This is the most common case.
    # You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar.
    # You then add cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull down menus
    # you wish to use in your menu bar.
    # You then create all of the pulldowns.
    # Once you have done this, specify the menu using the -menu option of the
    # toplevel's widget command.
    # See the toplevel manual entry for details.
    # This is the compatible way to do menu bars.
    # You create one menubutton widget for each top-level menu, and typically
    # you arrange a series of menubuttons in a row in a menubar window.
    # You also create the top-level menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie
    # them together with -menu options in menubuttons and cascade menu entries.
    # The top-level menu must be a child of the menubutton, and each submenu
    # must be a child of the menu that refers to it.
    # Once you have done this, the default bindings will allow users to
    # traverse and invoke the tree of menus via its menubutton; see the
    # menubutton manual entry for details.
    # Popup menus typically post in response to a mouse button press or
    # keystroke. You create the popup menus and any cascaded submenus, then you
    # call the tk_popup procedure at the appropriate time to post the top-level
    # menu. An option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu
    # that allows you to select one of several values.
    # The current value is displayed in the menubutton and is also stored in a
    # global variable.
    # Use the tk_optionMenu procedure to create option menubuttons and their
    # menus. You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the
    # top of an existing menu.
    # The default bindings will create a new menu that is a copy of the
    # original menu and leave it perma‐ nently posted as a top-level window.
    # The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the original menu.
    # and unposts the menu.
    # If the current menu is a top-level menu posted from a menubutton, then
    # the current menubutton is unposted and the next menubutton to the left is
    # posted. Otherwise the key has no effect.
    # The left-right order of menubuttons is determined by their stacking
    # order: Tk assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by default is the
    # first one created) is on the left.
    # Otherwise, if the current menu was posted from a menubutton, then the
    # current menubutton is unposted and the next menubutton to the right is
    # posted.
